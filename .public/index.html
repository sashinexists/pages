The purpose of the project was to remove all the stress of having to organise your windows across your workspaces and the unpredictability of where you put them later.\n\nWith all your open apps in a predicable place it was always easy to navigate to any of them in very few button presses.\n\n---\n\n## About the Project\n\nI was really enthusastic about the project and keen to help them while teaching myself more about making websites so I volunteered to create their website which I designed to mimic the look and feel of Material Shell itself.\n\nI used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) which I was interested in learning at the time. I've since changed my mind about them.\n\nI originally was also learning how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with this project, however the use of Google's [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) made it impractical.",

I approached him asking for business advice.\n\nFor years, have been running a blog for years on how the world works and how we can improve it. My intention, was and still is to be a writer, making a living from my work. Despite writing and publishing for two years and putting out over fifty essays, I had yet to make money.\n\nMichael was already running a successful business at this time turning over 100k annual revenue from his online Alexander Technique course.\n\nWhen going over everything, I showed him [my website](/project/sashinexists) and he was really impressed with how it looked. He asked me what I used to make it, and I told him I used Ghost. He told me he didn’t recognise the theme and I told him that I made it myself — and that’s the story of how I found myself hired to build Michael Ashcroft’s website.\n\n---\nThe [Expanding Awareness Website](https://expandingawareness.org) was built using [Ghost](https://ghost.org) — A modern blogging platform which is also what I’m using for my website. The work I had to do for Michael was essentially building him a custom Ghost theme.",

I would write thought pieces and post them on social media and share them with my friends. [The very first one was on the naturalistic fallacy](https://sashinexists.com/article/the-overrated-nature-of-nature/).\n\nIt was built with WordPress with a number of plugins and extensions and a custom theme which I built and appropriately called \"Sashin Exists\". It had a very similar colour scheme of black and green that the current site has, but different specific shades.\n\nThere were a lot of things I didn't like about WordPress including how clunky it was, the fact that it used the aging PHP and all the features it was bundled with that I honestly didn't care about. I wanted something cleaner and lighter, and I wanted building a theme to feel just like building a static site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\nIn 2018, I quit my full time Data-Entry job realising that there was no joy in the work at all and decided to purse writing full-time rather than as a side-project.\n\nThe first steps I made after quitting was to rebuild my website using [Ghost](/skills/ghost). Ghost ticked all my boxes in being modern, fast and pleasant to develop themes for. Building a ghost theme feels the same as creating a static HTML+CSS+Javascript website, with all the flexibility that entails.\n\nI hosted my new website using a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets) where I installed an instance of Ghost. \n",
